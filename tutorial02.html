		<p>Simplification is when the numerator and the denominator can be divided by the same number to get a simpler equivalent fraction. 
		This process is repeated until the fraction is put into simplest and lowest terms. 
		</p>
		<p>An example is 8/16. The numerator and denominator can both be divided by 2, to get 4/8. This can again be divided by 2, to get 2/4. 
		This can again be divided by 2, to get 1/2. Another example would be 9/12, we first look at it and notice that both can be divided by 3. So the 
		first time it is reduced it will be 3/4 because 9 divided by 3 is 3 and 12 divided by 3 is 4. Now it can no longer be reduced, so this is our answer.</p>
