		<p class="info">Fractions can be added together, as long as they have the same denominator. 
		If fractions do not have the same denominator, then the LCD should be found. Also, when adding fractions, only the numerators should be added.
		An example is 2/5 added to 3/4. We already determined in the previous section that the LCD is 20 and that the fractions are equivalent to 8/20 and 15/20. 
		The numerators, 8 and 15, are added together to get 23. This fraction then becomes 23/20. If changing this to a mixed number, then the answer is 1 3/20.

		<p class="info">Fractions can be subtracted from other fractions, as long as they have the same denominator. 
		If fractions do not have the same denominator, then the LCD should be found. Also, when subtracting fractions, only the numerators should be used to subtract. 
		An example is 2/5 subtracted from 3/4. From the section about LCD, we already determined that the LCD is 20 and that the fractions are equivalent to 8/20 and 15/20. 
		We now need to subtract 8 from 15, since we only use the numerators. This equals 7, so the fraction is now 7/20.</p>
