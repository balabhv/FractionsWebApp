		<p class="info">Improper, Proper, and Mixed Number Fractions
		Proper fractions are fractions where the numerator is less than the denominator. An example is 1/8.
		Improper fractions are fractions where the numerator is greater than the denominator. An example is 13/5.
		Mixed number fractions are fractions that consist of a whole number and a proper fraction. An example is 1 3/4.
		Improper fractions can be changed into mixed number fractions, and mixed number fractions can be changed into improper fractions. </p>
						
		<p class="info">When changing an improper fraction to a mixed number fraction, the first step is to figure out how many times the numerator goes into the denominator evenly. 
		Next, that number is multiplied by the denominator. This product is then subtracted from the numerator to get a new number. 
		This number then becomes the numerator while the denominator stays the same. 
		The whole number in front of the fraction is the answer that was found by figuring out how many times the numerator goes into the denominator. 
		An example is 13/5. The amount of times 13 goes into 5 evenly is 2. Then, 5 multiplied by 2 equals 10. Next, 13 subtracted from 10 is 3. The fraction then becomes 2 3/5.
		When changing a mixed number fraction to an improper fraction, the first step is to multiply the whole number with the denominator of the fraction.  
		This product is then added to the numerator. This sum becomes the new numerator, while the denominator stays the same. An example is 1 3/4. The whole number, 1, is multiplied by the denominator, 4, to get 4. This product is then added to the numerator, 3, to get 7. 
		The fraction becomes 7/4.</p>
